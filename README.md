**task - 01**

**COMPANY NAME**: CODTECH IT SOLUTION PVT.LTD

**NAME**: OM JOSHI

**INTER ID**: CT6WKCL.

**DOMAIN**: SOFTWARE TESTING.

**BATCH DURATION**: January 5th,2025 to February 20TH,2025.

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

**DESCRIPTION**:  Automating Login and Navigation Using Selenium WebDriver

Install Python and required libraries: pip install selenium.
Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver).
Write the Script:

Open the web application.
Automate login by finding the username, password fields, and login button.
Navigate through the application by locating and interacting with elements.
Sample Code:

python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Setup WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Use the path to your WebDriver if needed
driver.get("https://example.com/login")

# Automate Login
driver.find_element(By.ID, "username").send_keys("test_user")
driver.find_element(By.ID, "password").send_keys("secure_password")
driver.find_element(By.ID, "loginButton").click()

# Validate Login Success
assert "Dashboard" in driver.title

# Navigate to a Section
driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Profile").click()
assert "Profile" in driver.title

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
Run the Script:

Save the script as test_login.py.
Run it using python test_login.py.
Report Results:

Log successful login and navigation.
Handle and log any errors for failed test cases.

**DELIVERABLE: A SCRIPT REPOSITORY AND A TEST EXECUTION REPORT.**

Script Repository
A Script Repository is a centralized platform or storage location where automated test scripts, related code, and resources are maintained. It serves as the main archive for scripts used in testing, offering a structured way to organize and manage them. The repository helps ensure that testing scripts are easily accessible, version-controlled, and shared among the team members working on the project.

Key features of a script repository:

Version Control: Tracks changes to the scripts over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Collaboration: Multiple team members can contribute to the repository, enhancing collaboration and reducing duplication of effort.
Organization: Scripts can be categorized based on function, feature, or project to make them easier to find and manage.
Centralized Storage: With a centralized repository, all members have access to the latest version of scripts, improving consistency across testing efforts.
Popular tools used to create script repositories include Git, Bitbucket, and GitHub, which support features like branching, merging, and tracking code changes.

Test Execution Report
A Test Execution Report is a document or output file that summarizes the results of executed test cases during the testing process. It provides a detailed overview of the test execution status, helping stakeholders understand the effectiveness of the tests and any issues that need to be addressed.

Key elements of a Test Execution Report:

Test Case Details: The names or IDs of the test cases executed, along with any associated descriptions or IDs.
Execution Status: Information about whether each test case passed or failed. If a test fails, it usually includes error messages or stack traces to assist in troubleshooting.
Execution Time: The duration each test case took to execute, which can help identify performance issues.
Test Coverage: A summary of how much of the system or application was tested, often presented in terms of feature coverage or lines of code tested.
Defects: Any bugs or issues found during testing are often listed, including their severity, status, and any steps to reproduce.
Summary and Trends: A high-level summary that shows trends, such as increasing or decreasing test pass rates, which can indicate the stability of the application.
A test execution report is important because it offers stakeholders (testers, developers, managers) insight into the quality and stability of the software. It helps decision-makers understand whether the system is ready for deployment or needs more work.

Tools like JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, and others often generate these reports automatically. The format of the report can vary depending on the tools and preferences, but common formats include HTML, PDF, and XML.

Conclusion
In short, a Script Repository serves as a secure, organized location for storing and managing test scripts, enabling collaboration and version control. Meanwhile, a Test Execution Report provides a comprehensive view of the test execution results, helping identify defects and track test progress. Both are essential components of the software testing process, ensuring efficient testing, clear communication, and a reliable product release.
